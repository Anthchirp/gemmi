gemmi-convert (cif <-> pdb)
---------------------------

.. literalinclude:: convert-help.txt
   :language: console

We made an effort to format the PDB files we write in the same way as the
software used internally by the PDB, apart from writing fewer records.
Thanks to this, in some scenarios a ``diff`` tool can be used to compare
a PDB file written by Gemmi with an official PDB file from PDB.

The library and the converter also have an option (``--iotbx-compat``)
that formats PDB files more similarly to cctbx/iotbx.
One of the differences is formatting of the TER record.
We do not aim to be fully compatible here, but in some cases
a command such as ``diff --ignore-space-change`` may be used to show
differences between a files generated by Gemmi and CCTBX.


gemmi-convert `-`-expand-ncs
----------------------------

The file converter includes also a little utility to expand strict NCS,
which is defined in the ``MTRIX`` record in PDB, or in the ``_struct_ncs_oper``
table in mmCIF.

By default, new chains have different names than the original ones.
But when used together with ``--iotbx-compat``,
the program mimicks ``iotbx.pdb.expand_ncs`` and leaves the same chain names
while adding distinct segment IDs.
